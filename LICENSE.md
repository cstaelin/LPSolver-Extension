The *lpsolver* extension depends upon lpsolve55 java classes and native libraries available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/.  This is a package of free linear programming software made available under the GNU lesser general public license.  In the folder of the extension's source files, available at https://github.com/cstaelin/LPSolver-Extension, the lpsolve55 java classes are those files that are contained in the "lpsolve" sub-directory.  Also part of the *lpsolver* extension in the "lib" sub-directory are the lpsolve55 dynamic libraries, bundled in sets of two libraries, one set for each platform.  They are distributed under the same license terms.
